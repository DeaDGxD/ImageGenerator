### Main file is DrawImages.py

This program is converting many .txt files to .jpg with config where you can choose
- image resolution
- first and second font color
- background color
- min and max font size (automaticaly choose biggest possible for the largest line)

Every .txt file gets his own folder where 1 or more images are created

It also shift words to new line, and shift lines to new image if needed

To write in second font, just `im writing *on different color now*`

To switch to next image, place "%" between lines
